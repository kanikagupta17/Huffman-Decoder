# Huffman-Decoder
A decoder for Huffman Tree, reading the code table and encoded message and generates original message from the encoded file. 

The decoder reads two input files - encoded message and code table. The decoder first constructs the decode tree using the code table. Then the decoded message can be generated from the encoded message using the decode tree.
